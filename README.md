### Description
This dataset contains information about the top 500 posts from the subreddit r/Politics from September 18, 2023 - September 18, 2024. This data could be used to gain a comprehensive understanding of popular discourse, opinion trends, and information/misinformation dissemination within politics on Reddit. This data can be used for analyzing the political leanings of the posts, and identifying whether the top posts seem to exhibit left-leaning, right-leaning, or potentially misleading (fake news) tendencies.

**Each post object includes various metadata fields that provide detailed information about the post. Below are the relevant fields I used included in the Reddit API fetch:**
*id*: Unique identifier of the post.
*title*: The title of the post.
*score*: The score of the post (upvotes minus downvotes).
*url*: The URL of the post.
*selftext*: The text of the post (if it is a text post).
*author*: The username of the person who posted.
*created_utc*: The creation time of the post in UTC. (ONLY IN past_year_top_posts_API_RAW_DATA.json)
*num_comments*: The number of comments on the post.

**Added Field:** 
*created_date*: The creation time of the post in ISO 8601 format, converted from *created_utc*
*Rank*: The rank of the post ranging from 1-500 based on *score*
