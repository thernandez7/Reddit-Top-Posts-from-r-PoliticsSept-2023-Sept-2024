### Description
This dataset contains information about the top 500 posts from the subreddit r/Politics from September 29, 2023 - September 29, 2024. This data could be used to gain a comprehensive understanding of popular discourse, opinion trends, and information/misinformation dissemination within politics on Reddit. This data can be used for analyzing the political leanings of the posts, and identifying whether the top posts seem to exhibit left-leaning, right-leaning, or potentially misleading (fake news) tendencies.
