        "text": "On Tuesday, former president and current frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination Donald Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. [Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill\" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Trump Smashes Own Record With Third Criminal Indictment](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-charged-jan-6-probe-criminal-indictment-2023-1234794859/) | rollingstone.com\n[Grand jury indicts Donald Trump for alleged 2020 election conspiracies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/01/trump-indictment-jan-6-2020-election/) | washingtonpost.com\n[Read the Trump Jan. 6 Indictment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/01/us/trump-jan-6-indictment-2020-election.html) | nytimes.com\n[Trump indicted by federal grand jury in 2020 election probe](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-indicted-jan-6-grand-jury-2020-election-rcna95199) | nbcnews.com\n[Donald Trump indictment: Former president indicted again on federal charges in Jan. 6 investigation](https://abc7ny.com/amp/donald-trump-indicted-indictment-jan-6-grand-jury/13441242/) | abc7ny.com\n[Donald Trump has been indicted in special counsel's 2020 election interference probe](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/01/politics/donald-trump-indictment-grand-jury-2020-election) | cnn.com\n[Trump news live updates: Grand jury returns sealed indictment in 2020 election probe](https://www.msnbc.com/trump-investigation/live-blog/trump-indictment-jack-smith-2020-election-jan-6-live-updates-rcna97476) | msnbc.com\n[Trump indicted on charges related to efforts to overturn 2020 election](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-indicted-charges-related-efforts-overturn-2020-election/story?id=101612810&cid=social_twitter_abcn) | abcnews.go.com\n[Trump says he's going to be indicted again](https://www.axios.com/2023/08/01/trump-indictment-2020-election-jack-smith) | axios.com\n[Trump: Jack Smith will announce indictment at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp-video/mmvo189743173861) | nbcnews.com\n[Fulton County sheriff says threats have been made against himself, district attorney leading up to potential Trump indictment](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4131756-fulton-county-sheriff-says-threats-have-been-made-against-himself-district-attorney-leading-up-to-potential-trump-indictment/) | thehill.com\n[Trump Says He Expects to Be Indicted Today By Special Counsel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-01/trump-says-he-expects-to-be-indicted-today-by-special-counsel?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google) | bloomberg.com\n[Trump claims special counsel will indict him over January 6 on Tuesday evening](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-indictment-today-public-b2385900.html) | independent.co.uk\n['We have mugshots ready for you,' Georgia sheriff says ahead of possible Trump indictment](https://www.businessinsider.com/we-have-mugshots-ready-fulton-county-georgia-sheriff-trump-indictment-2023-8) | businessinsider.com\n[George Conway Offers Legal Advice to Trump Co-Defendant Following \u2018Damning\u2019 Indictment: \u2018Cooperate\u2019](https://people.com/george-conway-offers-legal-advice-carlos-de-oliveira-trump-classified-documents-case-7568316) | people.com\n[Donald Trump Has a Big Money Problem (the Millions in Legal Fees He Owes for All of His Alleged Criminal Activity) - It turns out lawyers are very expensive, especially if you\u2019ve been indicted twice and are expecting even more criminal charges.](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/08/donald-trump-legal-fees-money-problems) | vanityfair.com\n[Trump indicted over bid to overturn 2020 election result](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/01/trump-indicted-again-00109286) | politico.com\n[Read : Trump indictment in 2020 election and Jan. 6 probe](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/01/politics/read-trump-january-6-indictment/index.html) | edition.cnn.com\n[Indictment \u2013 #1 in United States v.

        "text": ">The Supreme Court on Monday restored Donald Trump to 2024 presidential primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot.\n>\n>The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously reversed a Colorado supreme court ruling barring former President Donald J.

However, the three liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 filed their own joint opinion concurring in the judgment.\n\nYou can read [the opinion of the court for yourself here.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-719_19m2.pdf)\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Supreme Court rules Trump cannot be kicked off ballot](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rules-trump-cannot-kicked-colorado-ballot-rcna132291) | nbcnews.com\n[SCOTUS: keep Trump on ballots](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-04/supreme-court-rules-trump-can-appear-on-presidential-ballots) | bloomberg.com\n[Supreme Court hands Trump victory in Colorado 14th Amendment ballot challenge](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4506318-supreme-court-trump-colorado-14th-amendment-ballot-challenge/) | thehill.com\n[Supreme Court keeps Trump on ballot, rejects Colorado voter challenge](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/04/supreme-court-trump-ballot-decision/) | washingtonpost.com\n[Trump wins Colorado ballot disqualification case at US Supreme Court](https://www.reuters.com/legal/trump-wins-colorado-ballot-disqualification-case-us-supreme-court-2024-03-04/) | reuters.com\n[Supreme court rules Trump can appear on Colorado ballot](https://www.axios.com/2024/03/04/supreme-court-trump-colorado-ballot) | axios.com\n[Supreme Court restores Trump to ballot, rejecting state attempts to ban him over Capitol attack](https://apnews.com/article/51e79c0f03013034c8a042cb278b6446) | apnews.com\n[DONALD J.
